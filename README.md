# Portfolio
A collection of client projects I've gotten to take on recently.

_Sidenote: I_ **will** _build a legit personal website — just as soon as I can come up with a design that satisfies my "perfectionism" (as friends call it). For now, this'll do._


## 1. SundryAgro E-commerce (Compl. 2024)

### About
An online marketplace linking buyers and sellers of natural foods. Based in Nigeria. Expanding soon.

### Tools
- WordPress

### Notes
- Was my first legit client project built entirely in WordPress.
- Remains the project with the highest amount of traffic (which makes sense given it's an active e-commerce foodstuff delivery service — what a mouthful)
- Couldn't implement a lot of things due to my limited expertise in custom WordPress dev.
- V2 in active development: New design, fresh features. I'm leaving WordPress behind and moving on to a Nuxt.js + Laravel combo (🔥🔥🔥). Will be out sometime in December 🕐.


## 2. Kyrix Investments (Compl. 2025)
### About
Website for Kyrix — an investment firm based in Namibia.

Check out [Kyrix Investments](https://kyrixinvestments.com).

### Tools
- WordPress, Custom theme, TailPress, TailwindCSS, GSAP, Lenis

### Notes
- Now **this** one I'm really proud of. It was the first project where I built a custom WordPress theme and actually got to interact with WordPress as a developer, and not merely a drag n' drop robot.
- Discovered [TailPress](https://tailpress.io) while working on this project. Really sweet stuff.
- Each sector of investment has a dedicated page. I had this idea to give each of those pages a distinct identity/color palette. I think it came out really neat. 🔥🔥🔥
- No V2. Unless they get in touch to say they want a rebrand. Maybe in a few years' time. 🤷🏾‍♂️😌

## 3. Buildev.io (In-progress)
### About
Tech venture studio platform launching in Nigeria.

Check out [Buildev.io](https://buildev.io).

### **Screenshots:**
_**Disclaimer:** View these with a pixel (or three) of salt. I'm working on a new version that looks **super duper** different. Something [Awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com/) level._

### Tools
- Nuxt.js, TailwindCSS, GSAP, Lenis, Rive

### Notes
- First client project built with Nuxt.
- Despite the disclaimer above, I _am_ proud of the webitse (sort of).
- Got to learn a little about [Rive](https://rive.app) and built some custom animations for the webpage (🔥). Too bad they'll be scrapped for V2. Oh well.
- Also discovered [Resend](https://resend.com). Made sending emails from a frontend-only app a breeze.
- There's a locked login link on the homepage 😏. It's a teaser for something really awesome that's in the works (70% done too).
